# AstroOrganiser
Astrophotography Capture Manager for organizing your astrophotography session data

![ScreenShot](/images/ss.png)

I wrote this application to aid me in my astrophotography from my home observatory. Its reasonably simple but simplifies the tasks I was performing, saving some time. It also features my AstroClock and AstroViewer.

I hope it will be useful for other astronomers, please feel free to provide feedback and feature requests.

Included here is an installer for the latest version of the application, or a folder containing the application should you wish to run it without the need to install it. This application is 64bit for Windows, I can also compile it in 32 bit should anyone really require it. I can also create customised versions but would expect a fee for doing this.

Version 2 includes a histrogram function which I have ported from a project by UEZ from AutoIt forums.

I have also tested under Linux x64 using Wine.
 - AstroOrganiser runs but folder naming doesnâ€™t automatically name the folder by date
 - AstroClock runs perfectly
 - AstroViewer runs perfectly except for image editing
